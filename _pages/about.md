# Data Enthusiast and AI Aficionado
I am a data enthusiast and an artificial intelligence aficionado, currently based in Tallinn, Estonia. Over the last 5 years, I have hustled in the tech industry from Venezuela to Estonia, working in diverse regions such as Europe, Africa, and Latin America. My work primarily involves creating robust cloud structures to handle large data volumes.

### Technical Skills and Interests 🖥️
I thrive in exploring various technologies such as **Airflow**, **CloudRun**, and **App Engine**, applying assets like **Python** and **SQL/Non-SQL** practices. I am continually innovating in the fields of machine learning and deep learning. My passion lies in the unique intersection of statistics and mathematics where I solve recurring business problems using techniques including computer vision, natural language processing, regression/classification algorithms, and neural networks.

### Recent Developments 🎯
Lately, I have been engrossed in learning **Julia** which I believe will further augment my skill set.

Do not hesitate to contact me for insightful discussions about horror movies or collaborations specifically towards Marketing Science! 😉✉️
